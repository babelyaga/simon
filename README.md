Hey there! Welcome to my Simon Says game. I built this as a JavaScript, HTML, and CSS implementation of the classic memory game. It's a practice project I created to explore vanilla web technologies and improve my coding skills.

## A Note on This Practice Project

I want to be upfront: I'm fully aware that using React and Redux would be a much better choice for building this game in a production environment. However, I intentionally chose to use vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as a learning exercise. My goal was to understand these core technologies without the abstraction of modern frameworks. It's been a great journey in understanding the fundamentals!

## Game Features

Here's what I've packed into this little game:

- Classic Simon Says gameplay with four colored buttons (red, green, blue, yellow)
- Progressive difficulty: I made the sequence speed up as you advance
- Current level display so you can track your progress
- High score tracking using local storage (can you beat your best?)
- A "Repeat" button to replay the current sequence (but use it wisely, only once per game!)
- "Reset" button when you want to start fresh
- "Dark Mode" toggle for a different visual experience (I thought it looked cool)
- Responsive design - try it on your phone!
- Sound effects for button presses (mute your device if you're playing at work!)
- Game over overlay to show off your final score

## How to Play

1. Hit that "Start" button to kick things off.
2. Watch and listen to the sequence I'll show you.
3. Repeat it back by clicking the colored buttons in the same order.
4. Get it right, and I'll add another step to the sequence. How far can you go?
5. Make a mistake, and it's game over! But don't worry, you can always try again.

## Game Controls

- **Start**: Kicks off a new game
- **Repeat**: Forgot the sequence? Use this to see it again (once per game, choose wisely!)
- **Dark Mode**: Switches between color and grayscale. I added this for fun!
- **Reset**: Starts a new game whenever you want

## Technical Stuff (for the curious)

- I built this with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3
- Used CSS Grid for the button layout (it's responsive!)
- Added some CSS animations for button feedback
- Implemented the Web Audio API for those cool sound effects
- Your high score is saved in your browser's local storage

## Setup

Want to run this locally? It's easy:
1. Clone this repo or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite modern web browser.
3. That's it! No npm install, no build process. Old school ðŸ¤“?

Or simply go to babelyaga.github.io/simon and start playing.

## What I Learned

Building this game with vanilla technologies taught me a lot about:
- DOM manipulation without the help of frameworks
- Managing state in plain JavaScript (it's trickier than it looks!)
- Handling events and creating a game loop
- Making responsive designs with CSS Grid and media queries
- Using browser APIs like Web Audio and Local Storage

## What's Next?

I've got some ideas for future updates:
- Refactoring to use React and Redux (I know, I know, I should have done this from the start)
- Adding more difficulty modes (think you can handle it?)
- Creating more visual themes
- Maybe a multiplayer mode?
- Hooking it up to a backend for global high scores

## Easter Egg

I've hidden a little surprise in the game that triggers after a period of inactivity. See if you can find it!

Thanks for checking out my project. I had a blast making it and I hope you enjoy playing! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Now, how far can you get in Simon Says?
